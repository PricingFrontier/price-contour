# Repository instructions

Read and follow `AGENTS.md` in this repository root. It is the authoritative source for engineering priorities, GitHub access, models and delegation, the fix-and-tweak workflow, targeted verification, releases, and the steps before a pull request. Do not layer older interactive plan-review, agent-pair, or review-team rules on top of these files.

# Model

Run Claude Code sessions on Opus 5.5 (`/model opus`); it is the best value for both judgment and implementation. Subagents inherit it; do not pin cheaper tiers or set `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`. When to delegate is in AGENTS.md's "Models and delegation". Do not enable Fast mode for routine repository work.

# Review policy: Codex reviews once per pull request

Reviews use a Codex model, because a review from another model family catches failures that a same-family review shares. AGENTS.md's "Code review with Codex" has the commands, the checklist, the severity scale and the approval gate. The review surface is exactly:

- Code / PR / diff review: once over the whole branch diff before the PR is opened or updated (AGENTS.md "Before a pull request"). Do not review each commit or package separately.
- Plan, design, or spec review: the same command with the plan-review prompt.
- Second opinion on a judgment call: the same command, advisory and never gating.

Run the Codex commands in the background and keep their state in the session scratchpad.

Do not delegate review to Claude subagents and do not run Claude-vs-Claude review workflows. The main session still inspects every subagent diff itself (that is verification, not review) and owns the completion decision after Codex findings are resolved or rebutted.

# Tests and CI

Run only the affected tests locally, as AGENTS.md's "Targeted verification" describes, and never the full Rust or Python suite unless the user asks; this applies to subagents too. Push and let CI run the full suite. Watch the PR's checks with a `Monitor` on `gh pr checks`, not a sleep loop. On red, read the failing job's log with `gh`, reproduce only that test locally if the cause is unclear, fix it, and push again until CI is green.

# Downstream consumer

haute (`../haute`) consumes this library, usually through an editable install of this checkout. A change to the public Python API, a result's shape, or a numerical rule is a change to haute's contract: say so in the PR, and bump the version according to "Releases" in AGENTS.md.

# Workflows

Dynamic workflows are opt-in ("use a workflow" / `ultracode`). Stages run on Opus 5.5; set effort per stage (`low` for mechanical fan-out, `medium` for bounded implementation). Keep the medium size guideline (under 15 agents) unless the task genuinely calls for more.
